/// InitState entry in our database. InitState serves two critical purposes - it helps both the
/// event blob writer and storage node initialize correctly and maintain event continuity given that
/// some initial event blobs may have expired (due to MAX_EPOCHS_AHEAD limitation).
///
/// For example: if there are total 1000 event blobs each containing 5 events that were generated
/// so far, and first 100 blobs have expired - a new node joining the network will bootstrap its
/// event db starting from event blob 101 with event index of the first event in its db being 500.

///
/// For Event Blob Writer:
/// - Needs to know how to start writing new blobs when joining the network
///   Uses InitState to:
/// - Get prev_blob_id to properly chain new blobs to existing ones
/// - Even if starting at event 500, needs to link to the blob that contained events [495, 499]
/// - Know which epoch it's starting in
/// - Ensures blob metadata is correct for that epoch
///
/// For Storage Node:
/// - Needs to know how to handle events when some early events aren't available
///   Uses InitState to:
/// - Recognize legitimate gaps in early events
/// - If starting at event 500, knows events [0, 499] are intentionally missing
/// - Can mark events [0, 499] as "processed" to prevent blocking
/// - Maintain proper event sequencing
/// - Won't wait forever for events that will never arrive (like [0, 499])
