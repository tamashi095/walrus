# Orchestrator

The Orchestrator crate provides facilities for quickly deploying and benchmarking this codebase in a
geo-distributed environment. Please note that it is not intended for production deployments or as an
indicator of production engineering best practices. Its purpose is to facilitate research projects
by allowing benchmarking of (variants of) the codebase and analyzing performance and robustness.

This guide provides a step-by-step explanation of how to run geo-distributed benchmarks on either
[Vultr](http://vultr.com) or [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com).

**Important**: This crate is not included in the workspace's default members; if you want to build,
test, or run it, you need to do that from *this* directory (`/crates/walrus-orchestrator`) or, when
running from the root of the repository, add `-p walrus-orchestrator` to the `cargo` commands.

## Step 1. Set up cloud provider credentials

To enable programmatic access to your cloud provider account from your local machine, you need to
set up your cloud provider credentials. These credentials authorize your machine to create, delete,
and edit instances programmatically on your account.

### Setting up Vultr credentials

1. Find your ['Vultr token'](https://www.vultr.com/docs/).
2. Create a file `~/.vultr` and add your access token as the file's content:

```text
YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Setting up AWS credentials

1. Find your ['access key id' and 'secret access
   key'](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds).
2. Create a file `~/.aws/credentials` with the following content:

```text
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Do not specify any AWS region in that file, as the scripts need to handle multiple regions
programmatically.

## Step 2. Specify the testbed configuration

Create a file called `settings.yaml` that contains all the configuration parameters for the testbed
deployment. You can find an example file at [`./assets/settings-template.yaml`][./assets/settings-template.yaml].

The documentation of the `Settings` struct in `./src/settings.rs` provides detailed information
about each field and indicates which ones are optional. If you're working with a private GitHub
repository, you can include a [private access
token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
in the repository URL. Your access token starts with `ghp_` and the repository URL should be formatted as follows:

```yaml
repository:
  url: https://$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/mystenlabs/walrus.git
  commit: main
```

## Step 3. Create a testbed

The `orchestrator` binary provides various functionalities for creating, starting, stopping, and
destroying instances. You can use the following command to boot 2 instances per region (if the
settings file specifies 10 regions, as shown in the example above, a total of 20 instances will be
created):

```bash
cargo run -p walrus-orchestrator -- testbed deploy --instances 2
```

To check the current status of the testbed instances, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -p walrus-orchestrator -- testbed status
```

Instances listed with a green number are available and ready for use, while instances listed with a
red number are stopped.

When utilizing a testbed on AWS, a common approach involves configuring the desired parameters and
maintaining all machines in a stopped state until necessary. This strategy helps control costs, as
keeping AWS instances stopped typically incurs minimal expenses, while starting them can lead to
significant charges. It's important to note that cost dynamics may vary among providers, so it's
advisable to thoroughly examine the associated costs for each operation before initiating
benchmarks.
